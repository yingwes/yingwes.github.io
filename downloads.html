	<p><a href="Three Sips Of Gin.mobi">Three Sips of Gin - Tim Bax</a> eBook. Autobiography on the life of a Rhodesian Selous Scout. Refreshing to read a war biography which does not attempt to be self-justificating, braggy or ard-core, but rather honest, humble en down-playing. What I get out of this book is that life is an adventure which one should not take too serious. Immerse yourself in the adventure and with the right attitude, everything will turn out great. (and that Rhodesians are awesome).</p>

	<p><a href="Point of Impact.mobi">Point of Impact - Stephen Hunter</a> eBook<. Old marine sniper gets framed in a conspiracy. Storyline runs as a detective-mystery, but the excitement comes from some epic sniper action. I enjoy the protagonist's character... tough, hard, and deadly when underestimated!/p>

	<p><a href="Far Horizon.mobi">Far Horizon - Tony Park</a> eBook. Much like Wilbur Smith. Ex-soldier become tour-guide, gets involved in tracking down a group of dangerous poachers. The journalist helping him (Sarah)is a treat... Sharp, goal oriented, emosionally hard-headed, proud and fearless.</p>
